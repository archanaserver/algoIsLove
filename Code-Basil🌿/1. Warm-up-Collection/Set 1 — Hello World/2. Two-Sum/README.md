### You're given an array of integers. Write a function that returns a pair of numbers such that they sum up to zero.

You can assume there will be exactly 1 solution. Each element in the array can only be used once.

**Example:**
Array of integers is [2, 7, 9, -2].
The pair that sums up to 0 is (2, -2).

**Input:**
A list of numbers, separated by space.

```2 7 9 -2```

**Output:**
2 numbers from the array that sum up to 0.
We will sort the 2 numbers for you so that you can easily compare with our expected output.

```-2 2```
