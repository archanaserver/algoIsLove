# BAG Data Structure 🛍

- Bag Data Structure is also known as **multiset**.

- It is an unordered collection of objects/values that may have duplicates. It contain collection of zero or more element of same type.

- Its Generalization is: It's kind of Abstract Data Type. 

- The order of insertion is
completely irrelevant. Elements can be inserted and removed entirely at
random order.

- If element are of same type in bag then it is called **homogeneous bag** otherwise **heterogeneous bag** in case of different types of element.

### Note 📝
_**A bag, or multi-set, is a set where values may be repeated.** Inserting 2, 1, 2 into an empty set gives the set {1, 2}. Inserting those values into an empty bag gives {1, 2, 2}. From another point of view, a set is unordered, too, but has each value at most once._

## Operations 🔍

1. _Adding_ elements to the bag.
2. _Removing_ elements from the bag.
3. _Testing_ if the bag is full or empty.
