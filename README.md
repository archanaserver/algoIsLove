# Algo is Love ❤️

Well this repo is for those who love to crack algo problem. So you are here I hope you know basic about Data Structure & Algorithms. Okay that's cool.

### Some points to keep in mind while solving problems:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Firstly break down the problem and note down the input, output, constraints & all edge cases.
* Go with the Brute Force/Naive Approach without bothering about its time and space complexity.
* Analyze the solution and find it's memoizing i.e. overlapping part.
* Break down your problem with the Top-Down Dynamic Approach(recursion + memoization) because it optimizes space and time complexity.
* Now, turn your solution with the Bottom-Up Dynamic Approach(using iteration) because that saves memory cost.
* That's it! You'll get the most optimal solution.

### Tips to solve algorithms on time:
1. Set a timer of 25 or 30 minutes.
2. Take 2 min for clarifying the problem.
3. 8–10 minutes for coming up valid optimum solution with its space and time complexity.
3. 5 min coding the solution.
4. 5 min for the dry run or testing your solution with an example.

I know, in the beginning, it's difficult to manage time. But believe me, you can do it by practicing.
Practice Makes You Perfect. So, Go For It.🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♂️
